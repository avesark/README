# Aves Ark Capstone Fall 2023

## By: Rose Mikan

> The project is a combination of digital records about Connecticut birds including narrative videos and short clip videos from original footage I recorded with digital cameras on location in Connecticut from March through November 2023; Taxonomy; Data Vizualizations from public datasets as well as combined datasets with additional specifics for each species; and space for additional pages of information about birds developed into a website entitled avesark with the intention of hosting future development from DNS: avesark.org, avesark.com and avesark.net which I secured earlier this year.

## General Information

- Bring attention to a problem most people seem unaware exists because they see many common birds, not realizing that so many birds are endangered, and that the common birds they seem to think are in abundance are actually the same birds traveling to and from their feeding and roosting sites.
- Offering easy site with information that is relatable to a general audience
- Support for the large organizations that protect birds

## Setup
The project is built in Framer with some of the pages built using the Framer CMS system for collections. These are to provide the ability to manage videos and content on the site with less technical staff. The site is built as a simple model for developing with any content managed system. 

## Technologies Used
- Framer
- Adobe CC
- Merlin Bird ID App
- MicrosoftÂ® Excel
- Tableau Software
- RAWGraphs
- Digital cameras


## Features
- Videos with narration and data animations over local bird footage in a variety of habitats
- Taxonomy chart for reference to Orders of birds including images
- Data Vizualizations covering Migration, Species recovery efforts, and Habitat studies specific to Connecticut Birds.


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ / _complete to demo_ / _migrating to hosting outside of E599 Framer Enterprise environment_. 

## Room for Improvement

Improvements:
- More micro animations and motion throughout the site
- Adjustments to breakpoints, specifically the footer positioning

To do:
- Add more content for the About pages
- Add more content for the Info pages


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by a very large Great Egret that was in my neighborhood and then I noticed he didn't return after 2020, also the bevy of swans that used to reside in New Haven is down to three, the cardinals that used to return to my yard every year until the new neighbor cut down all the indigenous growth, the monk parakeets that built and created several nest apartments in some very old Hemlocks that were gassed, and when some fledglings returned were chased away by crows and possibly some additional pesticide because it was sudden, and all the vulnerable, nearly threatened, least concern and extinct birds.
- Many thanks to Hongming Wang, Phd., and Dr. Bakhtiar Mikhak, Phd. from H.E.S., as well as to Ken Elkins
Director, Coastal Center at Milford Point, Connecticut Audubon Society, and to Robin Ladouceur
Senior Center Manager, Bent of the River Audubon Center from the National Audubon Society, and to all the people working to improve legislation, enforcement, research, counting and protecting birds.
- Special thanks to all of my Harvard Extension School professors, teaching fellows, and course mates for excellent instruction and inspiration.
-  Gratitude to my dear friend Bronwyn Burns for her support and voice to narration.
